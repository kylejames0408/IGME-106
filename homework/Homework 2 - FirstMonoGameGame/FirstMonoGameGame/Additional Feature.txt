My additional feature is the inclusion of a basic enemy that moves from left to right across
the screen. The Enemy class inherits from the GameObject class and upon collision with a
Player object will end the game. The enemy cannot spawn in the Player's spawn path. The
number of Enemies correlates with the level that the Player is on, slowly making the game
more difficult.
